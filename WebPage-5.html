Born and raised in a <i>Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu</i>, he studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the <mark>Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)</mark> and <mark>Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)</mark> and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>

<p>Kalam was elected as the <b>11th president of India</b> in 2002 with the support of both the <mark>ruling Bharatiya Janata Party</mark> and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his <i>civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term</i>. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour.</p>

<p>While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full state honours.</p>


<h3>Career as a scientist</h3><hr>

<p>After graduating from the <i>Madras Institute of Technology</i> in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam joined the <u>INCOSPAR, working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist</u>. He was interviewed and recruited into ISRO by <mark>H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launching Station (TERLS)</mark>.In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the <u>project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III)</u> which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.</p>

<p>In 1963 to 1964, he visited <i>NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and Wallops Flight Facility</i>. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam made an effort to develop the <u>Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and SLV-III projects</u>, both of which proved to be successful.</p>

<h3>Memorial</h3><hr>

<p>The <b>Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</b> National Memorial was built in <mark>memory of Kalam by the DRDO in Pei Karumbu</mark>, in the <i>island town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu</i>.
