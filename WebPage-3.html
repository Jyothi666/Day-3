<p><b>Jawaharlal Nehru</b>(14 November 1889 – 27 May 1964) was an <em>Indian anti-colonial nationalist, statesman, secular humanist, social democrat, and author</em> who was a central figure in India during the middle of the 20th century. Nehru was a <u>principal leader of the Indian nationalist movement</u> in the 1930s and 1940s. Upon India's independence in 1947, he served as the country's <mark>first prime minister</mark> for 16 years. Nehru promoted parliamentary democracy, secularism, and science and technology during the 1950s, powerfully influencing India's arc as a modern nation. In international affairs, he steered India clear of the two blocs of the Cold War. A well-regarded author, the books he wrote in prison, such as Letters from a Father to His Daughter (1929), An Autobiography (1936) and The Discovery of India (1946), have been read and deliberated upon around the world.
The son of <strong>Motilal Nehru</strong>, a prominent lawyer and Indian nationalist, Jawaharlal Nehru was educated in England—at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge, and trained in the law at the Inner Temple. He became a barrister, returned to India, enrolled at the Allahabad High Court and gradually began to take an interest in national politics, which eventually became a full-time occupation. He joined the Indian National Congress, rose to become the leader of a progressive faction during the 1920s, and eventually of the Congress, receiving the support of Mahatma Gandhi who was to designate Nehru as his political heir. As Congress president in 1929, Nehru called for complete independence from the British Raj.</p>

<h3>Birth and family background</h3><hr>
Jawaharlal Nehru was born on 14 November 1889 in <i>Allahabad in British India</i>.

<p>When World War I broke out, sympathy in India was divided. Although educated Indians <i>"by and large took a vicarious pleasure"</i>in seeing the British rulers humbled, the ruling upper classes sided with the Allies. Nehru confessed he viewed the war with mixed feelings. As Frank Moraes writes, "if [Nehru's] sympathy was with any country it was with France, whose culture he greatly admired". During the war, Nehru volunteered for the St. John Ambulance and worked as one of the organisation's provincial secretaries Allahabad. He also spoke out against the censorship acts passed by the British government in India.
Nehru emerged from the war years as a leader whose political views were considered radical. Although the political discourse at the time had been dominated by the moderate, <u>Gopal Krishna Gokhale</u>, who said that it was <mark>"madness to think of independence,"</mark> Nehru had spoken, "openly of the politics of non-cooperation, of the need of resigning from honorary positions under the government and of not continuing the futile politics of representation". He ridiculed the <b>Indian Civil Service</b> for supporting British policies. He noted someone had once defined the Indian Civil Service, "with which we are unfortunately still afflicted in this country, as neither Indian, nor civil, nor a service".Motilal Nehru, a prominent moderate leader, acknowledged the limits of constitutional agitation but counselled his son that there was no other "practical alternative" to it. Nehru, however, was dissatisfied with the pace of the national movement. He became involved with aggressive nationalists leaders demanding Home Rule for Indians.</p>
