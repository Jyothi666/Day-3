<center><h1>MAHATMA GANDHI</h1></center>

<b>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</b> was born on <mark>2 October 1869</mark> – 30 January 1948 was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahatma (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.

<p>Born and raised in a <u>Hindu family</u>in coastal <mark>Gujarat</mark>, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in London and was called to the bar in June 1891, at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he was unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian merchant in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. There, Gandhi raised a family and first employed nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon set about organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive land-tax.
Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International Day of Nonviolence. Gandhi is considered to be the Father of the Nation in post-colonial India. During India's nationalist movement and in several decades immediately after, he was also commonly called Bapu (Gujarati endearment for <b>"father",roughly"papa","daddy"</b>).</p>

<h3>Early life and background</h3><hr>
<h2>Parents</h2>

<p>Gandhi's father, <b>Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi</b> (1822–1885),served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.Although Karamchand only had been a clerk in the state administration and had an elementary education, he proved a capable chief minister.</p>

<h2>Childhood</h2>

<p>As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "<mark>restless as mercury</mark>, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears.The Indian classics, especially the stories of <i>Shravana and king Harishchandra</i>, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, Gandhi states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. Gandhi writes: <b>"It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number."</b> Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.At the age of nine, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near his home. There, he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography.At the age of 11, Gandhi joined the High School in Rajkot, Alfred High School.He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and <u>tongue-tied student</u>, with no <del>interet</del>interest in games; Gandhi's only companions were books and school lessons.<p>

<h2>Marriage</h2>

<p>In May 1883, the <mark>13-year-old Mohandas Gandhi was married</mark> to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia (her first name was usually shortened to <b>"Kasturba"</b>, and affectionately to "Ba") in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time. In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies.<i>Gandhi's wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married</i>. Recalling the day of their marriage, Gandhi once said, "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only <u>wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives</u>.In late 1885, Gandhi's father, Karamchand, died.[34] Later, Gandhi, then 16 years old, and his wife of age 17, had their <mark>first child</mark>, who survived only a few days."</p>

<h2>Salt Satyagraha (Salt March/Civil Disobedience Movement)</h2><hr>

<p>After his early release from prison for <mark>political crimes in 1924</mark>, Gandhi continued to pursue swaraj over the second half of the 1920s. He pushed through a resolution at the Calcutta Congress in December 1928 calling on the British government to grant India dominion status or face a new campaign of non-cooperation with complete independence for the country as its goal.<i>The Salt March to Dandi from 12 March to 6 April</i>, where, together with <b>78 volunteers, Gandhi marched 388 kilometres (241 mi) from Ahmedabad to Dandi</b>, Gujarat to make salt himself, with the declared intention of breaking the salt laws. The march took 25 days to cover 240 miles with Gandhi speaking to often huge crowds along the way.According to Sarma, Gandhi recruited women to participate in the salt tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity in the mainstream of Indian public life.However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because Gandhi feared he would be accused of using women as a political shield.When women insisted on joining the movement and participating in public demonstrations, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him.Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and <u>monopoly on salt mining</u>. On 5 May, Gandhi was interned under a regulation dating from 1827 in anticipation of a protest that he had planned.</p>
